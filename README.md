# Updates

- Add support for readline.
- More rigorous memory leak checks.
- Memory leak checks in child processes without false positives from external commands.
- File descriptor leak checks.
- Crash detection.
- Smart stderror comparison with bash.
- Minishell output filtering (start message, prompt, exit message).
- Output failed test cases and valgrind results to files.
- Updated test cases for updated subject (v7.1).
- Subshell test cases.
- Compatibility and tester speed-up with GitHub Actions.

# How To Install and Run

To install the script, copy and run the following command:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeaYeh/42_minishell_tester/master/install.sh)"
```

The tester will be installed in the `$HOME/42_minishell_tester` directory.

After installation an alias `mstest` will be automaticly added in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

So that you can run the program in any directory (where your minishell is) by calling

```
mstest
```

# Troubleshooting

## All my STDOUT/STDERR tests fail

  This is probably because you print something which bash does not print, at least not in non-interactive mode.
  What is non-interactive mode? Because the tester cannot simulate interactive user input coming from the terminal, it **pipes** the tests into the stdin of minishell/bash, (roughly) like this:
  ```bash
  echo -n "test-command" | ./minishell
  echo -n "test-command" | bash
  ```
  It then tries to filter out a lot of variances after capturing the output, but depending on your implementation, there might still be some differences between the outputs of your minishell and bash.<br>
  You can check the output in the `mstest_output` directory in your minishell directory to see which exact printouts cause problems.

  You can fix this in the following way:
  - Check in your code if you are in "interactive mode" (`isatty()`) and only print the problematic message if you are.
    This is how bash does it for its "exit" message too.<br>
    For more information, see [here](https://github.com/LeaYeh/minishell/pull/270).

# How to test with Valgrind

To manually test your minishell with Valgrind with the same flags as the tester, you can use this command:
```bash
bash -c '
export SUPPRESSION_FILE=$(mktemp)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeaYeh/42_minishell_tester/master/utils/minishell.supp > $SUPPRESSION_FILE
export VALGRIND=$(which valgrind)
export VALGRINDFLAGS="--errors-for-leak-kinds=all --leak-check=full --read-var-info=yes --show-error-list=yes --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=$SUPPRESSION_FILE --trace-children=yes --track-origins=yes"
export VALGRINDFDFLAGS="--track-fds=all"
export IGNORED_PATHS="/bin/* /usr/bin/* /usr/sbin/* $(which -a norminette)"
export VALGRINDFLAGS+=" --trace-children-skip=$(echo $IGNORED_PATHS | sed '"'"'s/ /,/g'"'"')"
export PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:$PATH"
$VALGRIND $VALGRINDFLAGS $VALGRINDFDFLAGS ./minishell
EXIT_CODE=$?
rm -f $SUPPRESSION_FILE
echo "Exit code: $EXIT_CODE"
exit $EXIT_CODE
'
```

# Disclaimer

DO NOT FAIL SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY AREN'T PASSING ALL TESTS!

NEITHER LET THEM PASS JUST BECAUSE THEY DO, CHECK THE CODE WELL!

DO YOUR OWN TESTING. TRY TO BREAK IT! ^^

HAVE FUN WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL MINISHELL

Tests without environment are a bit tricky to do well because if you run `env -i bash` it disables only partially.
It will still have most things, but if you do `unset PATH` afterwards, will see the difference.
Also this part is pretty much what you aren't required to handle.
The main point is to not to crash/segfault when you launch without environment.

Try to write your own test first and don't just run a tester mindlessly
You don't have to pass all the cases in this tester
If you want to check leaks outside of your manual checking:

[This is also a good one to check valgrind](https://github.com/thallard/minishell_tester)
A bit more time to set it up, but worth it
The first time if you run the tester above and expect a lot of errors
Then redirect each of the output from stdin and strerror to a file otherwise you won't be able see all of the errors

Even though the required changes have been made to your proram, it might still going to throw you only KO STD_OUT.
This is because readline version. (then you probably have the older version where it isn't checking where does the input coming from(the tester or you))

If a test just hanging in infinite loop, you can use the link to go there and comment it out in the test file until you fix it.
